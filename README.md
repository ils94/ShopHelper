# Flyff Universe Shop Helper

A simple program that will detect itens in player's shop and move your mouse to it.

# Setup

Download Shop Helper from this [link](https://github.com/ils94/ShopHelper/releases/download/release/SH.zip)

Open Shop Helper and go to any player's shop that contains the item you are looking for. Then, use Window's snipping tool to save the picture of the item you are looking for inside the folder: 

"C:\Users\YOURUSER\Documents\ShopHelper\Detection" 

Then, after doing it, press ' to start the image detection. If you open a player's shop that contains the image of the item you just saved, the program will move your mouse to that item.

You can have multiple images of multiple itens in inside the Detection folder, but it might slow down a bit the detection.
